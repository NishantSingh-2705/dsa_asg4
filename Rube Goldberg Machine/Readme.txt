HOW TO RUN:
1.To run code without any pre-installed compiler/IDE one can refer the below mentioned links:

  (To run this link one should have a proper internet connection.It's feasible both on laptop and mobile having a stable internet.)

2.To run code on internal environment like various IDE's (example:codeBlocks,codelite,Dev C/C++):
   -One can simply open the assignment 4.c file with their respective IDE's to run the code.
     For example:
       --if you use codeBlocks then simply follow these steps:
           2.1 Download the ZIP file from GCR and save it somewhere.
           2.2 Right click on file and click on extract Here option.
    NOTE-  2.3 Input.txt is the input file which should be placed in the same folder where the assignment.c file is present.
           2.4 After extracting you get a folder(Rube Goldberg Machine).In that folder you have assignment 4.c file.
           2.5 Try to run assignment 4.c file using codeBlocks (or any preferrable IDE you want).

    (DO THIS ONLY IF FILE FORMAT IS DIFFERENT ELSE FOLLOW THE ABOVE MENTIONED STEPS)

   In case assignment 4.c file is of different format like (.txt or other) you can change the format before running the code:
       --Right click on assignment 4.c file --> Go to properties --> General --> opens with --> change --> choose your IDE.

3.To run code with .exe file or command line:
        3.1 Download the ZIP file from GCR and save it somewhere.
        3.2 Right click on file and click on extract Here option.
        3.3 After extracting you get a folder(Rube Goldberg Machine).In that folder you have assignment 4.exe file.
        3.4 Run that file and give the required inputs as it is asked.
     
       In case assignment 4.exe file do not run ,then it means that you do not have a compiler to run the code.So in that case 
       one can download the compiler and set the path for it to run that .exe file using command line.
